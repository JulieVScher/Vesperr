            <p>
                <strong>2. USE OF COMPANY MATERIALS</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We may provide you with certain information as a result of your use of the
                Website including, but not limited to, documentation, data, or information
                developed by us, and other materials which may assist in the use of the

            <p>
                <strong>3. PAYMENT</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you make a purchase on the Website, you agree to provide a valid
                instrument to make a payment. Pay attention to the details of the
                transaction, as your total price may include taxes, fees, and shipping
                costs, all of which you are responsible for.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you provide a payment instrument to us, you confirm that you are
                permitted to use that payment instrument. When you make a payment, you
                authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full
                amount of the payment instrument you designate for the transaction. You
                also authorize us to collect and store that funding instrument, along with
                other related transaction information.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you pay by credit or debit card, we may obtain a preapproval from the
                issuer of the card for an amount as high as the full price. If you cancel a
                transaction before completion, this pre-approval may result in those funds
                not otherwise being immediately available to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates these
                Terms, or if we believe in doing so may prevent financial loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may contact your
                funding instrument issuer, law enforcement, or affected third parties
                (including other users) and share details of any payments you are
                associated with, if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss or a
                violation of law.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Payment for any ongoing services is billed automatically until notification
                that you would like to terminate your access to the services.

                services on the Website. We undertake to be as accurate as possible with
